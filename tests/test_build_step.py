"""Principle 6 gets a test (v0.12.0, Workstream 2).

> *"One runtime identity. One process, one SQLite, **a static UI with no build step and no npm**,
> environment variables as the configuration surface."*

That is the constitution's most structural clause and until this release **nothing in the suite
failed if a `package.json`, a `node_modules/`, a lockfile or a bundler config appeared.** Phase 0
demonstrated it: a tree carrying a `package.json`, three lockfiles, a `vite.config.js` and a tracked
`node_modules/` passed all 1302 tests. `SECURITY-REVIEW-0.11.0.md` §3.4 named that class, and the
release that is about to touch the UI is the moment to close it — v0.13.0 is exactly when the
temptation arrives.

### The tool / product distinction, written here because v0.13.0 will read it while vendoring

**Node as a test dependency is permitted. Node as a build step for shipped assets is not.**

The DOM harness (`tests/domharness/`) runs under Node. It is stdlib-only, needs no `npm install`,
vendors nothing, and produces nothing that ships: `pyproject.toml`'s `package-data` names
`ui/*` and `migrations/*`, and no `.mjs` file is inside it. The appliance still runs on five runtime
dependencies and a static UI a browser loads directly.

What principle 6 forbids is a **transformation between the source and what a browser receives**: a
bundler, a transpiler, a minifier, a lockfile that has to be resolved before the UI exists. The
test below does not care whether Node is installed; it cares whether the *tracked tree* contains the
apparatus of such a transformation.

### Why the file list comes from git

v0.10.1's F51 was a guard scoped by a literal string: `_SKIP_DIRS` excluded `.venv` **by name**, so
a virtualenv called anything else stopped being skipped and the guard started reporting on files
nobody in this repository wrote. A directory walk here would repeat it in the mirror image — an
artefact under a directory the skip-list happened to name would stop being *found*.

`git ls-files` has no such failure mode: it answers "what does this repository contain", which is
precisely the question. It also draws the line in the right place for the harness. An **untracked**
`node_modules/` that some tool created locally is not in the tree the maintainer ships and is not
what this guard is about; a **tracked** one is. §3 asserts both directions, through the same
extractor, against a real repository.
